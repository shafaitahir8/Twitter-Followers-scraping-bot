# Twitter-Followers-scraping-bot
The goal of this project was to develop a web scraper capable of extracting usernames of the followers and following of a particular user on Twitter. This was achieved by utilizing Python programming language along with the Twitter API and scraping libraries such as HTTPS requests and Selenium.

The scraper was designed to extract the data by navigating to the Twitter website and simulating the actions of a user interacting with the site, such as clicking on buttons and scrolling through the page. The data was then parsed and stored in a structured format in a CSV.

To ensure efficiency and accuracy, the scraper was designed with error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues such as rate limits and network errors. Additionally, the scraper was programmed to respect the Twitter terms of service and adhere to ethical scraping practices to avoid any potential legal issues.
Once the usernames were extracted, they could be analyzed or managed in a list for various purposes such as targeted marketing campaigns or social media analysis. Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to utilize programming and scraping techniques to extract valuable data from social media platforms.

#Potential Problems
###### API limitations: The Twitter API may have limitations on the amount of data that can be extracted within a given time period, which could slow down the scraping process or prevent data collection altogether.

###### Authentication issues: The scraper may encounter issues with authentication, such as incorrect or expired API keys, which could prevent it from accessing the data.

###### Network errors: The scraper may encounter errors due to network connectivity issues, such as server downtime or DNS resolution errors.

###### Incomplete or inaccurate data: The scraper may encounter errors when parsing the data, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate data.

###### Legal issues: If the scraper violates Twitter's terms of service or engages in unethical scraping practices, it may face legal issues such as lawsuits or account suspension.

###### IP blocking: Twitter may block the IP address used for scraping if it detects suspicious activity, which could prevent the scraper from accessing the site altogether.
