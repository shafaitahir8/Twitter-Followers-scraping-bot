# Twitter-Followers-scraping-bot
The goal of this project was to develop a web scraper capable of extracting usernames of the followers and following of a particular user on Twitter. This was achieved by utilizing Python programming language along with the Twitter API and scraping libraries such as HTTPS requests and Selenium.

The scraper was designed to extract the data by navigating to the Twitter website and simulating the actions of a user interacting with the site, such as clicking on buttons and scrolling through the page. The data was then parsed and stored in a structured format in a CSV.

To ensure efficiency and accuracy, the scraper was designed with error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues such as rate limits and network errors. Additionally, the scraper was programmed to respect the Twitter terms of service and adhere to ethical scraping practices to avoid any potential legal issues.
Once the usernames were extracted, they could be analyzed or managed in a list for various purposes such as targeted marketing campaigns or social media analysis. Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to utilize programming and scraping techniques to extract valuable data from social media platforms.
